A funtion takes an array of randomly generated 51 numbers from the range 20 to 100. Used different methods to perform tasks on those variables.

Task #3 

Benchmark library is used to compare the time constrait taken to execute a code. The two function being compared were the recursively written

Initalization of the tree class and its instance variables were used to traverse through the hash passed as a tree. The key of the hash was assigned to 
node name and the value to the keyword "hash".If the value is in the hash or the objects ancestry tree.For each key in the hash a recurcive tree class object is 
called if the hash value matches.  And other bode blocks were used to print the name of the node. 

Task #5 

Throught the implementation of polymorphism and inheritence, the Parent Class(shape) and two children classes(circle and rectancle)
